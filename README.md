## Spoop iOS
Track your poos and [Open Biome](//openbiome.org) poo donations from your phone.


iOS app integrates with the web app+API [also on Github](//github.com/rotblauer/spoop), so you can poop anywhere and check out the shiny graphs when you get to a big screen.


The iOS app (this one here!) is built with Ionic, using a particular generator ("M-ionic"). [See the original README](./README_generator.md) to learn more about both the generator and Ionic's opinions.
